#Creating Lists and Dictionaries
#Save each of the following lists and dictionaries into variables. You will use them throughout the assignment.

#Eg. fav_colours = ...

#Create a list for each item below that contains the given information:

#your favourite colours
#the age of you and your siblings/cousins/friends
#flip a coin 5 times and record whether or not the result was 'heads'
#your three favourite performing artists

#Create a dictionary for each item below that contains the given information:

#three words and their definitions
#your favourite movie names and their year of creation
#three cities of the world and their population
#the names of your siblings/cousins/friends and their ages

#After you've done that you should run your code to make sure there aren't any syntax errors. 
#You should get in the habit of running your code after each step in order to catch any mistakes as soon as they're introduced.
